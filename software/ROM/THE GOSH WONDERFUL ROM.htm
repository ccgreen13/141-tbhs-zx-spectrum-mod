    ROM modified by Geoff Wearmouth in November and December 2003.

    The ZX Spectrum ROM is copyright Amstrad PLC.

    Amstrad have kindly given their permission for the redistribution of 
    their copyrighted material but retain that copyright. 

    The gw03.rom is forward and backward compatible with the original 
    16K Spectrum ROM.  It is therefore very straightforward to use.
    You already have a manual for it but if not one is available 
    online, again thanks to Amstrad PLC.  

    The gw03.rom is more compatible with the BASIC manual than the 
    original 1982 ROM.

    In addition the BASIC now has a RENUMBER and BLOCK DELETE that were 
    standard on BASIC implementations of the 1970s and 1980s and it is 
    much easier to keep track of FREE memory and channels.

    The ROM is fully compatible with the ZX Printer and also ZX Net and     
    Interface 1 ( as of version 1.26 ). It works well with ResiDOS.

    Version 1.29 is fully compatible with the Plus D and DISCiPLE disk interfaces.  
    Version 1.31 rectifies a fault discovered in the tokenizer found by Andrew 
                 Owen.
    Version 1.32 introduced abbreviated keyword entry as suggested by Andrew.

    All such help is gratefully received at the email address on the main page. 


    Tokenizer
    =========

    The most obvious difference is in the editor as keywords have to be 
    typed in letter-by-letter.  A consequence of this is that keywords
    should not be used as variable names.  It is also not possible to 
    enter PRINT CODE "BORDER" in 'L' mode. 

    You may wish to revert to the original editor and you can toggle
    between the two modes by entering 'STOP' at the command line.
    After loading a snapshot the keyboard mode may change and 'STOP'
    should be used to select the preferred keyboard mode.
    Games should be loaded from 'tap' files which do not affect the keyboard 
    setup.

    This method of typing in full is great especially if you work with 
    different languages. As a shortcut a keyword can be entered in abbreviated
    form e.g.
    10 r.	gives 10 REM
    10 ra.      gives 10 RANDOMIZE

    Extended Commands
    =================

    Apart from 'STOP', the other keyword that would have no meaning when 
    entered directly is 'REM' and this has been used to add additional direct 
    commands.

    Entering 'REM' at the command line shows the commands and the version 
    number of the ROM.  The commands must be preceded by 'rem' entered in 
    either upper or lower case.

    REM streams
    -----------
    This is inspired by 'Stream Lister' which appeared in a microdrive
    book by Andy Pennell and while this is just a cut-down version, it 
    helps keep track of which streams are in use. 

    An estimate of free memory appears at the top of the display and this
    is useful when developing programs.  It is adjusted to give the same 
    result as

    PRINT 65536-USR 7962

    which still works and gives the result <b>41473</b> on a standard empty 
    Spectrum. 
    With Interface 1 attached, and the extra system variables created,
    the result is <b>41415</b>.

    It is especially useful when used with Interface 1 and the M.G.T. 
    Interfaces, and free memory will fall as extra channels are used and rise 
    when they are closed.

    The command has revealed a new bug in the Interface 1 and if you enter

    OPEN #4, "S"
    REM streams

    then the new stream will be shown but you have to enter CLOSE #4 not 
    once but twice for the stream to actually be closed.

    REM delete  {first} {last}
    ----------
    The Block Delete is simple and will delete all BASIC lines between the
    first and last line supplied.  The BASIC lines supplied must both exist
    in the program and be in low-high order.  Only spaces are allowed as 
    separators.  The streams command will show how much memory has been 
    reclaimed.

    REM renumber  {start} {step} {first} {last}
    ------------  
    This is the most powerful command and renumbers all or part of your 
    program.  Free memory will be affected one way or another and it is best 
    to avoid using this utility when memory is low.

    REM renumber 

    on its own renumbers the entire program starting at line 100.  All 
    instances of 'GO TO', 'GO SUB', 'RESTORE', 'LIST', 'LLIST', 'RUN' and
    'SAVE LINE' will have their arguments adjusted where appropriate.

    REM renumber {start}

    will start renumbering at the given line number using steps of ten.

    REM renumber {start} {step}

    will vary the step between lines.

    REM renumber {start} {step} {first}

    will only renumber the last part of the program commencing at the line 
    specified by the parameter first.

    REM renumber {start} {step} {first} {last} 

    will restrict renumbering to a limited range of line numbers.  This can 
    be used to smarten up a subroutine but can also be used to re-arrange 
    sections of program.  As long as they fit and don't overlap another 
    section, then <b> a range of lines can be moved to a new position. </b>

    The renumber always terminates by bubblesorting the BASIC program
    which is nice as bubblesorting in BASIC was one of the first things 
    I experienced on my ZX Spectrum.

    Bubblesorting a large BASIC program can take several minutes.

    NON MASKABLE INTERRUPT
    ======================

    The NMI routine has had its original functionality restored and the default
    functionality is to perform a warm restart.

    Originally the Spectrum was to use the address held in NMIADD
    23728 and 23729 as a vector to the NMI routine. 

    These two locations are now left blank and activating the NMI jumps
    to address $121C where a few bytes have been added to achieve a warm
    restart. 

    Since the Spectrum was first introduced the Interface 1 now uses
    23728 and 23729 to control printer width overwriting any value you
    might load there when they are first paged in.

    Furthermore the Plus D and DISCiPLE will suppress error messages if
    location 23728 is non-zero. 

    If no hardware conflict exist then you may activate the original 
    functionality by making RASP (which normally holds 64) hold an odd
    value such as 63. The ROM will then use the address in NMIADD if it is 
    non-zero. 
    

    Although the default Warm Reset was intended to aid the machine code 
    developer, it enables programs like Bomb Jack (IM2) and programs on 
    the Games microdrive to be broken into to study the programming techniques 
    used.

    However a large number of test programs were found to alter CHANS,
    the length bytes of BASIC lines and the address of E-LINE etc. making
    the success of any Warm Reset a hit-and-miss affair with anything 
    other than one's own programs.

    The Main ROM NMI is not used with the M.G.T. interfaces, ZXCF or
    ZXATASP which page in their own ROM's when address $0066 is reached.

    The DISCiPLE and Plus D disk interfaces
    =======================================
    To make these systems more robust the CLOSE routine now uses a look-up
    table with a zero end-marker and takes appropriate action if the 
    channel identifier is not present with the standard command
    e.g. CLOSE #7 (instead of the M.G.T. command CLOSE #* 7).
    The console input routine which accepts a single key only has been 
    improved as the version 1.28 routine only worked with the Plus D.
    Channels opened by the M.G.T. Interfaces show up in the streams display
    with a letter 'D'.

    Other Features
    ==============

    The development has always been short of room. Some well known 
    imperfections have been altered to give a more satisfying response and 
    a full list follows.

    Source: Understanding Your Spectrum by Dr. Ian Logan, 1982.
          (12 bugs listed in appendix)

    1) 	The 'division' error - is a misnomer.  The inaccuracy mentioned occurs
       	in the DEC_TO_FP routine and by switching the multiply and division
       	operations (at $2CDA) then 0.5 is given the floating point 
        form 80 00 00 00 00.  The suggested fix is ignored.

    2)  The '-65536' error e.g. PRINT INT -65536 gives -1.
       	Dr. Ian Logan's fix applied (with mods) (at $3221 ) and other code 
        sections ( at $30E5) NOT removed as suggested.

    3)  The 'ZX81 program name' routine (at $04AA) removed along with REC_EDIT.
        The above space has been re-used.

    4)  The 'CHR$ 9' error corrected by calling PO_ABLE in preference to a
       	terminal jump to CL_SET/PO_STORE.
 
    5) 	The 'scroll?' and 'Start tape' errors corrected by new routine 
        CONS_IN which only accepts a single ASCII key (or ENTER).

    6) 	The current cursor error corrected by updating E_PPC_hi instead 
        of E_PPC_lo.

    7)  The 'leading space error' has not been corrected and this means that
	listings on screen or paper will appear exactly as they do in books
	and magazines. (Originally this was corrected).

    8)  The 'K-mode' error has not been corrected as the preferred mode is
	letter-by-letter input of tokens.

    9) 	The 'CHR$ 8' error has been corrected as suggested by Dr. Frank O'Hara.

    10)	The 'SCREEN$' error has been corrected by substituting the suggested 
	RET instruction. (at $257D)

    11) The 'STR$' error has been corrected by removing the extra zero from
       	the calculator stack as suggested (at $2E25). Space was created by 
        changing a nearby JP instruction to JR.

    12) The 'CLOSE' error has been corrected by checking the status of the
       	stream and issuing an error message if it is already closed.
	This is more in keeping with the OPEN command which issues a message
	if the user stream is already open.
        For the benefit of M.G.T. disk interfaces a look-up table with a
        zero end-marker is now used.
 
    Source: The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly. by Dr. Ian Logan and
           Dr. Frank O'Hara, 1983 (various additional features listed).

    1)  The NMI bug has been corrected and the logic changed as suggested on
       	Page 2. The new default set-up is to perform a warm reset using some
	original code. Setting RASP to an odd value allows the original
        NMIADD vector to be used.

    2)  Simple strings are not excluded when saving DATA - on Page 22.
       	e.g.  10 LET a$ = "dodo" : SAVE "animal" DATA a$()
       	These are now rejected as they won't load back in.
       	(credit: First fixed by Dr. Ian Logan in the Interface 1 ROM).

    3)  There is now an end-marker for the CLOSE STREAM LOOK UP table although  
       	this was not required in the original stand-alone ROM.
 
    Source: ZX Spectrum BASIC programming by Steven Vickers, 1982.
	  (discrepancies)

    1)  Line number should be optional in SAVE "some name" LINE - Page 133.
       	Not Fixed for compatibility reasons although it is a 1-line change.
        If RUN can default to zero then autorun should default to the same.

    2)  CLEAR does a RESTORE (Page 124).
        This seems to be an error in BASIC manual rather than ROM - ignored. 
	It is not clear what functionality Dr. Vickers intended. One could 
        make a logical case for either.

    3)  "Notice that the numbers in a DRAW statement can be negative, although
        those in a PLOT statement can't" - Page 92
        Fixed.  0&lt;=x&lt;=255. 0&lt;=y&lt;=175 else Error B.

    4)  Similarly the POINT (x,y) function allowed negative coordinates.
        Fixed.  Error B unless 0&lt;=x&lt;=255. 0&lt;=y&lt;=175. Page 153.

    5)  The ATTR (y,x) function allows negative and invalid coordinates.
        Fixed.  Error B unless 0&lt;=x&lt;=31 and 0&lt;=y&lt;=23.  Page 152.

    6)  The SCREEN$ (y,x) function allows negative and invalid parameters.
        Fixed.  Error B unless 0&lt;=x&lt;=31 and 0&lt;=y&lt;=23.  Page 154.

 
    Source: The Pitman Pocket Guide to the Sinclair Spectrum by Steven Vickers,
	  1984.  (discrepancies not previously mentioned.)
	
    1)  RESTORE. "Don't specify numbers &gt; 9999, as the program may crash."
       	To be pedantic &gt; 16383 - see below.                              

    2)  "'Statement lost' can occur with RUN, GO TO and GO SUB when the line
       	number is between 32768 and 61439."
       	Fixed by new routine which checks SAVE LINE, LIST, LLIST, RUN, GO TO,
       	GO SUB and RESTORE for invalid line numbers.

    3)  "Due to a bug, if you bring in a peripheral channel and later use a
       	colour statement, colour controls will be sent to it by mistake."
       	Fixed by ensuring that the screen is first selected by CLASS_07
	and CLASS_09 routines.

    4)  EDITING KEYS TABLE                                               
       	When inputting from the network or RS232 or microdrive file,
       	code 6 (comma separator): inserted in buffer.
       	("This is a bug. It should work like CHR$ 14"). 
	Not fixed. The workaround (using ' as an output separator works O.K.)
 
    Source: www.nonowt.com "Bugs in the ROM"
    ( many already covered. Some are Programming Guides rather than errors. )

    1)  The Monopolizing of IY Error.
       	Although not strictly an error, the manual does not mention the
       	restriction as did the ZX81 manual. ( Oh yes it does! )
	Not fixed for compatibility reasons.
	The interrupt routine continues to use the IY register.

    2)  The PR_CC error (credit: Dilwyn Jones 1983).
	Not fixed. The system variable 23681 should not be used.

    3)  The CLEAR PRINTER BUFFER Bug.
	The COPY command still needlessly clears the printer buffer but the
	possibility of an 'Out of screen' message with for example,
	PRINT : COPY : PRINT 
        has been removed by setting bit 1 of FLAGS during the routine.

    4)  The MAIN-4 COPY-BUFF Error.
	The possibility of an 'Out of screen' message has been removed
	by having CLEAR_PRB set bit 1 of FLAGS to indicate that the ZX
	printer position rather than the screen position should be updated.
        'LPRINT "p"; : PRINT' and then 'PRINT' works OK. Minor.

        Note the same fault is created by Interface 1 when an error report
        is generated as the code at MAIN-4 appears in Interface 1.
        10 LPRINT "p" ; : PRINT : GO TO 20
        will generate the report 'Program finished, 10:3' and corrupt the 
        print position. This is also cured with the gw03 ROM.

    5)  The MAIN-4 HALT instruction not corrected as it is no longer an error.
	Its original purpose as a safe resting place for the program counter 
        when a return is made with interrupts disabled has been restored.
       	The NMI fix provides a clean means of continuing should the situation 
	arise.  i.e. should a programmer forget to enable interrupts before 
        returning to BASIC.  The HALT instruction was specifically put there
        for that purpose?  [1]

    6)  The WRITE TO ROM at $0000 by SKIP_CONS has been avoided by simply   
       	placing the unwanted values where the wanted value will go.

       	The WRITE TO ROM by the SCROLL routine (credit: P.Giblin) has been
       	avoided, as suggested, by ensuring that the full 24 lines are not
       	scrolled.

    7)  The unimplemented e-to-fp calculator instruction could be removed by
        assigning $3C to 're-stack'.  Five calculator routines would require
        alteration.  This would only gain two extra bytes of ROM space and has 
	not been done for compatibility reasons and the meagre benefit.

    8)  The INKEY$ #0 Error.  This could apply to any stream although streams
       	0 and 1 read from the keyboard by default.  If the selected stream has 
       	been attached to the keyboard then the null string is almost always 
       	returned.  Not fixed as of no practical use.
 
    Miscellaneous BUGS and features.
 
    1)  In graphics mode, keys V, W, X, Y and Z give inappropriate keywords.
        Fixed by not storing a key if higher than 'U'.

    2)  A typo like LIST 40000 was silently changed to LIST 7232.  Fixed.
       	As an error is now given, the modifying code (AND $3F) has no effect
	and has been left in.

    3)  ED-RIGHT altered to prevent the cursor being positioned between a 
    	control character and its parameter.  (credit: Andrew Owen)

    4)  Pressing ENTER while in Graphics or Extended mode did not cause a   
        reversion to 'KLC' mode. Very minor indeed. As with most of these, I 
        am embarrassed to mention it.

    5)  It was the intention that stream 0 should be associated with the 
        INKEY$ keyword and stream 1 should be associated with the INPUT
        keyword but the order of routines in the INPUT command routine
        prevented the latter and associated both commands with stream 0.
        This has been fixed and

        OPEN #1,"S" : INPUT a$ 

        now gives Error-J as it should have done originally.

 
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Technical Information 
    =====================

    The renumber will successfully renumber lines that contain machine code
    in REM statements in particular if they contain chr$ 13 and chr$ 14.

    If there aren't twenty free bytes available to stack the four parameters
    or their defaults then the Renumber will fail at the start with the 
    report 'Out of memory'.

    The Renumber can still run out of memory if, for example, a lot of GOTO 10
    statements are changed to GO TO 1000.  If that occurs then it will resort 
    to completing the number using GO TO VAL "1000" which can actually increase
    free memory.

    The NMI checks the value of RASP 23608 and if bit 0 is set it uses   
    the address of NMIADD (23728 and 23729) as the service routine.
    Normally RASP has bit 0 reset and the NMI service routine performs
    a Warm Reset as happens with the Enterprise Elan.  Many programs use extra 
    protection which means that you may still not arrive at the command line.

    Programs that use ROM pages to vector Interrupt Mode 2 mode should work as
    locations $38FF, $39FF, $3AFF and 3BFF address the 16 bit values $FFFF.



    The ROM can be used with most emulators.

    The BACTERIA emulator uses the spare space before the character set for
    its help system but as long as F1 isn't pressed, I have found no problems.

    The ROM will not be compatible with the Opus Discovery Disk Interface
    which copies substantial chunks of ROM into RAM, sticks a RET on the end
    and executes them there.

    Gosh Wonderful ROM and ResiDOS
    ------------------------------

    ZXCF is a Compact Flash card for the ZX Spectrum designed by Sami Vehmaa.
    It allows a choice of ROMS, files and snapshots to be held in non-volatile
    RAM within a smart interface.
    ResiDOS is the clever BASIC extension, designed by Gary Lancaster, that 
    operates the Flashcard interface and provides the optional task manager.

    My experience has been through the MS-DOS RealSpec emulator.
    The GW03 ROM can be used directly from within the emulator.
    Just stick the file gw03.rom in the RS home directory and select it 
    using F3. 

    ResiDOS emulation allows you to experience the gw03 ROM on a whole
    other level, creating what would be, in real hardware, my dream machine.

    If you have the emulator working, then this is how to use the gw03 ROM
    from within ResiDOS.

    Backup your realspec.ini file first.

    Go to Sami Vehmaa's site 
  
    http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/

    click on 'News' and download the command reference. Print it off for later.

    Next download "config,hdd(cf)..."  realspec_r14.zip which contains
       realspec.ini		( realspec config )
       hdd0.HDF			( 16Mb emulated Flash Card )
       zxcf.bin 		( 1 Mb emulated RAM )
       allegro.cfg 		( sound config - not important) 

    Type realspec and press RETURN when prompted
    Press Ctrl-F4 and then Esc

    At this point the ZXCF initialization screen should appear.

    Wow! That covers normal emulation. Experiment and come back.

    Next go to Gary Lancaster's ResiDOS site

    http://www/zxplus3e.plus.com/residos/index.html

    and download the tapfile for the latest upgrade - currently 
    residos181cf.tap

    Restart the emulator initializing with Ctrl-F4 Esc as before.
    Now select the tape file and load it.
    When prompted, reply with 'u' for upgrade and upon 
    rebooting the version number should be as expected (currently 1.81).

    Now use ALT-F9 to load a memory block in this case the ROM file.
    Use values start = 32768, length = 16384 and tab down to 
    LOAD MEMORY BLOCK, press ENTER and select gw03.rom
    
    Type SAVE % "gw03.rom" CODE 32768,16384

    Type CLEAR 29999                 and then RETURN.

    Type LOAD % "gw03.rom" FORMAT 1

    Type FORMAT % "gw03"

    From now on whenever you type realspec it will use the gw03.rom
    after initialization with Ctrl-F4 and Esc.

    The Sea Change ROM
    ------------------

    I may as well explain this here. It's an experimental ROM that ZXCF 
    handles.  On real hardware install this as a non-Basic ROM on a Spectrum
    with Interface 1 attached. 

    After CLEAR 29999 

    Type LOAD % "sc01.rom" FORMAT 0
    Then FORMAT % "sc01"

    Try OPEN #7,"T"
    PRINT #7,"Testing"
    CLOSE #7 

    to send the text to an RS232 device.  Note. that the Interface 1 ROM is 
    never used with this setup. All that is of interest is the hardware.
    Network to another Spectrum and pass characters between the two.
    The network is not totally compatible with the Interface 1 and you will
    need two ResiDOS machines to pass programs between each other.
 
    To a certain extent, it can be emulated in RealSpec.
    It requires that the realspec.ini file be altered to use Interface 1.
    The Communication Ports need to be set up with the addresses of 
    BCHAN_IN and BCHAN_OUT in the sc01.rom.
    These are currently      IN 1843 OUT 19A5.
    You can redirect output to a file SERIAL.BIN

[1] The explanation for the HALT instruction is a little fanciful.
I don't think consideration was given to the assembly language programmer
elsewhere.
It may have been a means of communicating a signal to some external hardware.
As it was never used, it could be changed to EI but it is surprising how 
many crashes on Interface 1 (loading a large program) and the DISCiPLE disk 
Interface (CLOSE #4) end up at this location with interrupts disabled.
For authentic hardware crashes the HALT should remain.
